<h1>MODEL DEPLOYMENT</h1>

Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. Because of its ease of use, we leveraged Streamlit to create an Interactive Web application to predict if a given input is Fabricated or Real News. 

By using Streamlit components, we created Buttons, Sliders, Text box, Activities etc., where users can input to classify News.


<h3>STEPS INVOLVED :</h3>

1. Created Models
2. Pickled and saved the models. 
3. Set up a streamlit instance on our local machines.
4. Leveraged “Session” to unwrap the model using “Model unwrap”.

<h3>PREDICTION :</h3>


* A user can comprehend if the news is fabricated which is based upon the machine learning model created using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Randomn Forest and Gradient Boost algorithm.  

* The user has to enter the News, either the title or text from an article. 

* The web page indicates if the News is falsified or not, depending on the user input.
